description: Directory structure and key files for the Lazy Artist CV task repo
---

Project layout (expected):

- `configs/` : YAML configs for experiments
  - `baseline.yaml` : baseline “cheating” model config
  - (later) `robust_*.yaml` : intervention configs
- `src/` : all reusable Python code (not notebooks)
  - `data/` : dataset generation + dataset classes (Colored-MNIST)
  - `models/` : CNN/ResNet models, registry/factory (if used)
  - `interpret/` : interpretability (Grad-CAM from scratch, activation maximization)
  - `utils/` : seeding, logging, metrics, helpers
  - `train.py` : training entrypoint (reads config, writes runs/)
  - `eval.py` : evaluation entrypoint (hard test, confusion matrix)
- `notebooks/` : REQUIRED experiment logs (Task 0–4 notebooks)
  - `00_dataset.ipynb` : generate + sanity-check Colored-MNIST
  - `01_lazy_model.ipynb` : baseline training + collapse analysis
  - `02_interpretability.ipynb` : ActMax + Grad-CAM visuals
  - `03_interventions.ipynb` : 2+ anti-spurious strategies + ablations
- `runs/` : generated outputs (NOT committed) — logs, checkpoints, figures
- `reports/` : final writeup/presentation + exported figures

Conventions:
- Notebooks should call into `src/` instead of re-implementing logic.
- Save plots/tables used in the report under `runs/<run>/figures/` and/or `reports/figures/`.
