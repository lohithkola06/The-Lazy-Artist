Applies to `notebooks/**/*.ipynb`.

- Each notebook starts with:
  - Goal (1–3 bullets)
  - Environment / seed cell
  - Imports from `src/` (avoid re-implementing core logic)
- Every experiment must log:
  - config/hyperparams
  - final metrics (easy vs hard test)
  - key plots (distribution checks, confusion matrix, CAM overlays)
- Save important artifacts (figures/tables) to `runs/.../figures/` and link them in the notebook text.
- Keep notebooks restartable top-to-bottom (no hidden state).
