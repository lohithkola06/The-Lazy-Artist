When asked to add, edit, or refactor Cursor rules for this project:

1) Store Project Rules as separate files under `.cursor/rules/` (one rule per file).
2) Keep each rule focused and short (aim: 15–40 lines).
3) Prefer “Apply to Specific Files” for path-scoped rules, and keep globs tight.
4) Prefer “Apply Intelligently” for project knowledge (structure, stack, workflow).
5) Avoid “Always Apply” unless the rule is truly universal and low-risk.
6) If a new rule overlaps an existing rule, merge or update the existing one instead of duplicating.
7) If you introduce a new folder/file convention, also update the Project Structure rule.
8) Do not commit large datasets, checkpoints, or run artifacts; ensure `.gitignore` covers them.
