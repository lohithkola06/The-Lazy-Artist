Applies to `configs/**/*.yaml` and `configs/**/*.yml`.

- Keep configs minimal and explicit.
- Don’t duplicate defaults across many files—factor shared defaults if needed.
- Use consistent keys: run, seed, device, data, model, train, eval.
- Document any non-obvious hyperparameter in a short inline comment.
